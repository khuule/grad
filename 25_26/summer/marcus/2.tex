We'll start with finishing the proof of Corollary 2. We have that for $\alpha=r+s\sqrt{m}$, $r,s\in \Q$, for $s\ne 0$, the monic irreducible polynomial over $\Q$ having $\alpha$ as a root is
\[
x^2-2rx+r^2-ms^2.
\]
Hence, $\alpha$ is an algebraic integer if and only if $2r$ and $r^2-m s^2$ are integers. Now if $m$ is squarefree, then we must have $m\equiv 1,2,3\gmod{4}$.

In the proof of Theorem 2, the polynomial is monic, since it's the characteristic polynomial of $M$ (in $\alpha$).
